# Expand Selection package.

**DEPRECATED** - Check out [atom-expand-region](https://github.com/aki77/atom-expand-region)

The feature you don't know you need, but you can't live without!

![expand-selection](https://raw.github.com/mrolla/expand-selection/master/docs/expand-selection.gif)

Being a daily user of JetBrains products, the expansion of the selection is one of the editor features I really missed when I tried to use Atom seriously.
After few days of frustration, I decided to implement it myself and this package is the result.

For any bug or request please open an issue.
